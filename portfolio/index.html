        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>With a background in customer service and a growing expertise in front-end development and software engineering, I
            am driven by the vision of creating innovative websites and applications that have a meaningful impact. My experience
            spans three years in customer service, proficient in English and German, and includes a promotion to Real-Time
            Analyst (RTA), where I honed my skills in data analysis and visualization.
            I am currently focused on advancing my technical skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, supported by certifications from
            IBM and ALX. My educational foundation from the Faculty of Commerce at Cairo University complements my technical
            proficiency, allowing me to merge analytical thinking with creative problem-solving. By developing projects like Parallax
            and restaurant websites, I aim to leverage my skills to contribute to the tech field both locally and globally.</p>
